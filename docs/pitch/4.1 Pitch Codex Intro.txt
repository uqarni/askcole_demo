Traditional Way Of Pitching
* What’s being taught now
   * “2 minute *vague* over overview of what you do
   * Feature → Benefit → Advantage
      * Ex: One 1o1 call once weekly which will give you accountability so that ultimately you can stay on your diet consistently and therefore lose the weight you want and be more attractive to the opposite sex. 
* 2 reasons why this is not longer *ideal* 
   * “High-Ticket Coaching/Consulting” Is SATURATED & COMPETITIVE
      * A lot of sales training (in the high ticket world) was created in a time where getting on a call to buy consulting was rare (for the info world). Now, info-marketers need to step their game up when it comes to their sales process.  
   * “Post-Trust Era” 
      * Information is abundant
      * This gives buyers more and more options and more control over the purchasing process
      * This means buyers (and money) will shift more towards those who have the best OFFERS not those who are the best salespeople. 
      * 75% of the success/failure of the sale comes down to the offer


The “New” Way Of Pitching - The Pitch Codex™ 
* The Pitch Codex™ is a way to pitch your product and services over the phone inspired by old school direct response. 
* Why is this superior?
   * Now, we’ll not only be the best salespeople our prospects have spoken with but we will have a very clear “no-brainer” offer perfectly tailored to the prospects situation. 


Element of The Pitch Codex™ 
* Unique Mechanism
   * This is our “proprietary method”
      * “You’ll discover my “Pitch Codex™” framework for creating sales pitches that sell” VS. I will teach you how to craft your pitch…
      * Separates ourselves from the competition // can’t google/research
      * This is NOT a fancy name. This is a 3-5 step process (or thesis) that explains the path to success for your market. 
      * This acts as the simultaneous explanation of why everything they tried in the past has failed, why the majority of the market is failing, and why you’re approach is different, unique, superior. 
* Why Use A Unique Mechanism?
   * “New opportunity” that separates us for anything similar they’ve tried in the past and failed (or even better - justifies WHY what they tried didn’t work) 
      * Ex 1 - In my training we’re going to have group coaching sessions where I train you how to ask the right questions on your sales calls and handle objections
      * Ex 2 - I’m going to teach you how to create the “objection-less close” by learning the 7 beliefs your prospect must have to buy (and how you can easily “install” them on your calls by using my “reverse-selling system” so that you can close 50% or more of your prospects without having to memorize a bunch of canned rebuttals 
* Bold And Specific Promises
   * Hard vs Soft Offers
      * Hard offers are more TANGIBLE with makes prospects more CERTAIN
   * Soft: Promising what we’re going to do. 
      * Ex: we’re going to work together for 8 weeks, have one 1o1 call a week so that (benefits)
   * Hard: Promising the RESULT in specific timeframe (and what we’re going to do) 
      * This is a 4 step process to not only get you closing at least 30% of your calls in 8 weeks but also turn your sales process into a high-converting asset that ANY sales rep can step into and close. 
         * Adjust your promises based on what is realistic and you can actually do for each specific prospect (aka - don’t lie) 
* Creates A Logical Bridge From Current → Desired Situation
   * The 3-5 steps you create (aka your “pillars” or your thesis) will act as the step by step process of how to get from A → B. 
   * Should make it ABUNDANTLY clear 
   * You know you have this right when the prospect has an “aha” and says something like “This makes absolute total sense” 
      * Ex: Offer Creation // Organic Lead Attraction // Paid Advertising // Team Building
Common Pitfalls With The Pitch Codex™ 
* Thinking that the tactics will matter more than the fundamental principles.
   * It’s NOT about the fancy names, benefits, uniqueness, how you anchor cost, future pace...etc etc
   * It’s about giving a prospect complete clarity on what they need to get from point A to point B while at the same time explaining why they’re stuck (and/or why things they’ve tried in the past haven’t worked and therefore, how this will be different). 
* Sounded scripted
   * If you read this word for word from a script, it’s not going to work. 
   * We want to script it, but it should be 100% natural (think of an actor) 
      * Drill it til’ it’s burned into your brain. 
* Overcomplicating it
   * Confused prospects don’t buy
      * Don’t overcomplicate it
      * Don’t make it clunky / scripted 
   * Remember: Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. 
   * When in doubt: KISS


Pitching Phase Overview
* Pitch (three parts) 
   * The Promise
      * “Hard Offer” 
      * This reminds the prospect it’s not about the process it’s about the RESULT! 
   * The Bridge / Thesis 
      * Pillars
      * It’s about giving a prospect complete clarity on what they need to get from point A to point B while at the same time explaining why they’re stuck (and/or why things they’ve tried in the past haven’t worked and therefore, how this will be different). 
   * Delivery
      * This explains how it’s delivered and why it’s delivered that way (ties to benefits and eliminates objections)  


Committing Phase Overview:
* Temperature Check
   * This ties our prospect down on the process and allows us to eliminate uncertainty based objections before the close
   * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT!!! 
* Next Steps
   * This allows us to paint a clear picture of what’s going to happen AFTER the prospect makes the investment, before actually telling them what the investment is. 
   * This raises the prospects level of certainty
* Investment
   * Extremely simple explanation of the price
   * (Optional) Price anchoring.

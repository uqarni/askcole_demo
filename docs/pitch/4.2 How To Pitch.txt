What We’re Going To Cover:
* The 3 Parts To The “Pitching Phase” & The Purpose Of Each Part
* How To Construct Each Part For Your Specific Offer


3 Phases Of The Pitching Phase & The Purpose Of Each Part: 
* High Level Promise
* Bridge (Pillars) 
* Delivery 


High Level Promise
* The high level promise is 1-2 sentences that states the “end promised result” your offer is designed to provide. 
* Purpose:
   * Gets clients associated with the RESULT (not the process)
   * Raises certainty
   * Provides “tangibility” 
* Key Elements
   * Specific in outcome in a specific time
   * 30% closing ratio in about 8 weeks. 
   * ***Don’t overthink this. It’s valuable but not the most important part of the pitch. 
* Formula
   * This is going to be [# of pillars] to get you from [current situation] to [desired situation] in [approximate time frame]
   * “This is going to be 4 steps to get you from having zero control on your sales calls to a consistent 30% closing ratio in about 8 weeks time”  


The Bridge (Pillars)
* Your bridge are the 3-5 pillars that logically take your prospect from current situation to desired situation. 
* Key Elements:
      * Builds a logical step by step process that gets your prospect saying “that makes perfect sense”
      * Is positioned as something new and unique
         * “Simultaneous explanation of why they’ve failed in the past and why this is going to be different” 
      * Build certainty & future pace the prospect
      * Eliminates the “fear of success”  
      * Can include fancy names and “unique mechanisms” but if that is forced and overdone it will backfire. 
         * If the four pillars hit all the key elements above and are explained properly (again simultaneous explanation of why everything they’ve tried in the past has failed and why this is going to be different) then you don’t need fancy unique and proprietary names. The explanation itself will be unique just by the way you did it. 
         * The process altogether IS the mechanism. 
   * For STA, here’s our four pillars: : 
      * Sales Systems
      * Recruiting Pipeline
      * Onboarding & Ramp Up Systems
      * Management & Leadership
        ***Notice how they’re not super crazy fancy names. But the process as a
Whole IS the mechanism. Now, if I had 50 competitors, I may
        Have to get slightly more creative…
   * For 7FSA we used these:
      * Pitch Codex™
      * Sales Process Breakdown
      * Pipeline & Follow Up Systems
      * Ascension


Explaining Your Pillars:
* After you state each pillar and have the prospect right it down, you are going to briefly explain it. 
   * We do this because the pillars by themselves mean nothing to the prospect. 
   * The explanation is far more important. 
* Key Elements
   * VERY simple and clear***
      * Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. 
   * Benefit linking
      * Here’s what were going to do… so that you can (benefit)... and ultimately (benefit of that benefit). 
   * Problem linking
      * Most of the market trips up on (mistake) and because of that (reason why that mistake is a problem) which ultimately means (consequence)... so because of that, we do ___ so that you can (benefit) and ultimately (benefit of that benefit) 
   * It’s pertinent to the problems they told you earlier on the call “you told me…”
   * You tie it to benefits that relate specifically to them and what they told you they want. 
   * Tie down and open up for questions on each pillar
   * (optional) Communicate the consequence of not having each pillar (cost anchoring). 
* Three formulas for explaining your pillars. 
   * Nailing the “key elements” is more important than getting the formula perfect! 
   * If it sounds scripted, you lose. (Think actors)
   * FYI - next training will be me demonstrating for an example. 
* Formula #1 
   * Formula #1
      * Feature —> Logical Benefit —> Emotional Benefit —> (Optional: Consequence)
      * Tie down
      * Ex: 
         * The last thing is sales team build - sales team build...
         * So final step we’ll take is to start hiring you sales reps so that you don’t have to take all the calls yourself anymore and you can start working on the business, not in the business, which will ultimately allow you to have that sense of freedom in which you can go on a week long vacation without a laptop attached to your side. 
         * Does that make sense? 
         * What questions do you have on that, specifically? 
* Formula #2
   * Same as formula #1 but the lead in is different when you have the prospects language about their logical/emotional pain. 
      * You know how you told me… [logical pain]
      * And it’s making you feel…[emotional pain] 
      * Well what we do here is [deliverable/how it works]
      * So that you can have [logical benefit]
      * Which will allow you to [emotional benefit]
      * Tie Down “Make sense?”
      * (Optional: And the reason why this is so important is that [consequence of not having pillar] 
   * Works best if you write it using the formula then script it to sound natural while talking out loud (lots of times, formula won’t sound natural)
   * The note taking system (Week 3) is how I tee up these phrases. 
   * Example: 
      * So you know how earlier on the call you mentioned you were stuck in the day to day sales and it was making you feel like you had a job instead of a business? 
      * Well, once we get the first three pillars down, the last thing we’ll do is start to put the right systems in place to bring on your first few sales reps so that you don’t have to take all the calls yourself anymore and you can start working on the business, not in the business, which will ultimately allow you to have that sense of freedom in which you can go on a week long vacation without a laptop attached to your side. 
      * (Consequence) And the most important part about this - is finding the right sales reps to begin with. Sales reps are the most expensive hire in your business. For instance - it’ll take about 30 calls to see what a closers true closing percentage is, and if your offer is say - 5k - that’s literally staking 150k worth of business on someone you don’t even know is going to pan out. So the real key to this is actually being able to vet the reps on the front end and only hire the ones that have the highest probability to succeed - does that make sense? 
* Formula #3
   * Very similar to #2, except instead of using their language you actually use the current state of the market and explain the mistakes the market is making, the problem with those mistakes, and the consequences of not fixing it. 
   * This create a very good Us vs Them and/or New vs. Old frames
   * FYI - this is what I use the most, by far. It’s great because it’s educational and anchors cost well. It’s also easy to script and you can use it almost every time.
      * I use a combo of this and #2. 
   * Formula
      * Most of the market is doing this … (the mistake)
      * Now, here’s why that’s a problem … (explain the problem)
      * And what happens because of that is… (the reason the problem is a problem)
      * Which ultimately means … (the ultimate consequence of the problem). 
      * So instead, what we do is… (the feature)
      * So that you can… (inverse benefit of the problem)
      * And ultimately… (benefit of the benefit). 
   * Example: 
      * The biggest area coaches and consultants trip up is building their house on a foundation of sand with a very “me-too” offer…
      * The reason why this is a problem is two fold…
         * One - if your message is the same as everyone else, then you’re just shouting from the crowd and there’s nothing that makes you stand out, which makes it very hard to build compelling marketing that’s going to work
         * Two - if you’re the same as everyone else, then you’re a commodity. Why? Because the only thing that differentiates you now is price. 
      * So what happens is not only do you struggle to build compelling marketing, but the economics of the business become unscalable because you’re not charging enough…
      * And the worst part about that is - you might get to 20k/m but you’re capped working 80 hours a week and hate your business. And because you don’t have the cash flow to bring on team, you’re stuck. And the only way forward is to go 5 steps backward and start the process again…
      * So because of that, the very first thing we do is build out what’s called your offer codex your offer codex…
      * This way, you can (back to benefit linking). 


Putting this together for the first time may be a little bit choppy… Watch how I do it in the following example video. You’ll see how it’s less about using the exact formula “word for word” and more about incorporating all of the key elements above in a way that’s super smooth and natural. 
Explaining Delivery 
* After we tie down all the pillars, we’ll give a brief explanation of how those pillars are fulfilled. 
   * The prospect’s mind will naturally start to drift from “what” to “how” so we want to address this upfront and control it. 
* Key Elements
   * This is where you risk “getting into the weeds” keep it high level and benefit rich
   * Keep it very short - only say enough so that 1) you’re setting proper expectations and 2) it makes sense how it’s delivered at a high level
   * Be careful of saying anything that might trigger the “this is more of the same” feeling
      * I.e “Group Coaching Calls vs Sales Clinics” 
   * Use to eliminate any objections/concerns 
      * “How fast am I going to get support” 
      * What happens after? 
      * Will I get lost / am I going to have enough support to be able to apply general —> specific? Etc etc. 
   * Also - if you offer onboarding calls and/or 1o1 support I recommend using the second framework and “punting” specific questions. Very effective. 
* Example #1 (Better if you don’t do 1o1, onboarding calls, etc. Strictly Group) 
   * In terms of how this is all fulfilled, the in-depth training platform will be something you will have lifetime access to so that you can use it to train all your current sales reps as well as all the ones you hire in the future. 
   * We will also meet twice a week for a “sales clinic” where we’ll take what’s in the training and make sure it’s applied to your specific situation, offer, and roleplay it to really “cement it in”. 
   * And on top of that you’ll have 1o1 access to me M-F 9-5 through voxer, so that I can coach you on the spot on the day you have calls. Plus, that way if you go into a slump… I can break you out of it within a day opposed to you having to wait 4-7 days til our next clinic. Make sense? 
* Example #2 (better if you do 1o1, OB and you’re a hybrid). 


So to build all this stuff out and get you everything you need, it’s going to take 90 days. 
Everything is all customized. So once you enroll, we’ll give you some initial intake homework to complete. Once you’re done with that I’m going to personally hop on a 1o1 with you where we’re going to map out your implementation pathway. 


Which is basically.. 


* The exact gameplan for the next 90 days
* The SOPs we need you to go through now
* Items I need you to take care of
* Items that I’ll take care for you
* How often we’re going to meet


And so on. Does that make sense? 


Next Steps:
* Go through committing phase next (this is after you pitch)
* Then go through the demos
   * Do multiple times. Listen to again and again and again…
* Finally, complete the worksheet on constructing your entire pitch on your own. 
   * Drill this again and again til it becomes SUPER natural 
   * I would rather it be natural then follow the frameworks to a “T” yet be sound scripted.

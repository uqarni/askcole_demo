Call Introduction
What We’re Going To Cover:
* Rapport Myths & Best Practices
* The Opposing Agenda Of You & The Prospect 
* Rapport Specific Scripting
* Frame Specific Scripting 


Rapport Myths & Best Practices:
* “Rapport” is the part of the call from where the prospect answers until you set the agenda. 
* What are our outcomes during rapport?
   * Demonstrate your a normal human being
   * Make sure the prospect is in a good time/place
   * Get in rhythm with the prospect and smoothly transition into setting the agenda. 
* What Rapport is NOT:
   * Not a time to talk about your favorite baseball teams
   * Not a time to talk about your/the prospects life story
   * Not a time to talk about how nice the neighborhood or school system is 
   * Etc.. 
* Rapport short be very brief & short. 
   * Imagine what a doctor would do if you had a broken arm…?
* How do we get in rhythm with the prospect?
   * Initial mirror and match
   * Visual / Audio / Kinesthetic
   * Caveat: don’t mirror apathy / guilt / shame  


The Opposing Agenda Of You & The Prospect
* You and the prospect are on the call for different reasons
   * Prospect: To gather information
   * You: To facilitate a transformation. 
* The more information you disclose, the less leverage/leadership you have in the process. 
   * 2-call close
   * Payment plans (follow-ups)
* Because of the opposing agendas we must create an agreement at the beginning of the call on how the call will go. 
   * We want to frame this agreement in moral authority (see inner game of sales) 
* “Framing the call” allows you to take leadership of the call.
   * If you are not leading the call, you will NOT make the sale. 


 
Rapport


Hey is this NAME? 


Hey - It’s Cole - What’s up? 


Awesome - I was actually just ____ 


Been having a good week so far? 


Great well - I know we got a limited amount of time here so you ready to jump in? Got a clean sheet of paper, something to takes notes with? 
----- 
(if skeptical - is Now still a good time to connect?) 


Frame #1 


Gotcha - so what I’ve found to work best on these calls is first diving deeper into the specific of your business and sales process, how that’s working right now, and ultimately what you feel are the specific challenges keeping you from moving forward. 


Now once we get some clarity there - if we can help then I’m more than happy to walk you through that or wherever you wanna go and if not we can figure out whatever else is best - I might refer you out to someone we know, give you some homework to work on in the meantime, whatever you need. 


Cool? 


That being said… probably our best place to start is tell me what the biggest challenge with your sales is right now… what’s not working? 


Frame #2 (More Sophisticated Buyers) 


I’m definitely prepared to share a little bit more about what we have going on over here. 


Now, everything we do is all customized. So opposed to going through a long laundry list of every little different thing we could do for a potential client and be on here for hours… what’s probably going to be more appropriate is to first help me get some context on your business and what you’re trying to do, then based on that I can share with you only the aspects of what we do which would be relevant and useful to you specifically. Does that make sense? 


So with that said...what would you say, right now, is your biggest challenge? Or at least what’s not working at the level you truly feel like it could be or it should? 


Frame #3 (Slight Adjustment To Frame #2)
You can start the convo off by saying:
“So what stuck out to you about that ad/post/etc that made you reach out?”  


Gotcha, makes sense. I’m definitely down to share with you more about that. Now, everything we do is all customized (proceed with Frame #2) 


^^^^ This framework helps the prospect feel like they’re more in control.


Which should you use? 
* Don’t overthink it… use frame #1.
* If your market is very sophisticated and/or skeptical (real estate agents, etc) use frame #2 or #3 (whatever you feel more comfortable with) 
* ALWAYS end with the “challenge” question. So so so so so important.

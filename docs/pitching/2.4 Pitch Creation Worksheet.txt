This worksheet is designed to help you develop the “pitching phase” of your Pitch Codex™.


This is the MOST important part. This phase (and worksheet) can also be used to create (or refine) your offer. 


Do not forget - your offer/pitch is the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the entire call. Especially with how competition is today. 


Take your time with this, and let me know if you have questions / need feedback.

Step 1: Get Clear On The Transformation


What is your clients current situation vs desired situation? List that below. 


Current:
Desired: 


Step 2: List All The Steps


Think of all of the clients you’ve worked with in the past (or possibly even your own transformation) what are the steps you had to take to go from current → desired situation? 


List ALL of them in chronological order below: 
(Tip: Consider foundational roadblocks, tactical roadblocks, mindset issues, biggest fears, where your clients got stuck/needed most support in the past, etc)




Step 3: Get Clear On Which Steps Are Most Essential


Answer the following questions to help you get more clarity on your steps:


* Are there any steps that will give your clients a quick win? 
* Are there any steps that will give your clients an immediate sense of clarity? 
* What are the 20% of the steps that drive 80% of the results? 
* What are the 20% of the steps most desired by 80% of the market? 
* What steps are unnecessary (and should be automated, delegated, or eliminated)?
* What steps give clients the most success in the shortest amount of time? 
* Where do clients get stuck, need support, or fall off? (How can you create a step around this?)
* Are there any steps that eliminate the “fear of success”? (The next problem the prospect will have after they solve their core problem). 


Step 4: Narrow Down Steps Into “Pillars”


Based on the questions above, narrow down to 3-4 steps (now called “pillars”). 


Here’s some general guidelines/best practices of how I like to do it: 


Pillar #1: 


* Include elements to give the client a quick win/result 
   * Ex: asset utilization
   * **You can also use this element with your onboarding (i.e call reviews) 
* Include “foundational” elements that NOT having would make everything else irrelevant or ineffective
   * Ex: Your offer, if you sell facebook ads.
* The first element explains why what they tried previously didn’t work (similar to above)
   * Ex: your offer, if you sell paid ads
   * Ex: your energy, if you do sales training. 


Pillar #2 & #3:


* Should flow in logical order from the first pillar
* Don’t make all “IP”
* Often will solve the “core issue” 
   * Ex: I help you FIRST with your pitch (foundational) then with your sales process (core issue) 


Pillar #3 or #4:


* Should eliminate “fear of success” (solve the next logical problem the clients have AFTER they solve the core problem)
   * Ex: After you have consistent lead flow and are closing consistently, then next you’ll hire a sales rep. 


List your steps below (don’t worry about fancy names for now): 


Step 5: Develop Your Proprietary Method


Take 1-2 of the pillars and create your own “IP”


For example:
Sales Pitch → Pitch Codex™


Sales Coaching → Reverse Selling System™ 


Then leave the other ones “common sense” (yet obviously desirable)


For Example:


Pipeline & Follow-Up Systems


Sales Team & Scaling


Pro Tip: Typically your want to “IP” the beginning elements that solve the core issue (and also where you have the most competition). 


Warning: Do NOT overcomplicate this!!!


Step 6: Develop Your “High Level Promise”


This is going to be [# of pillars] to get you from [current situation] to [desired situation] in [approximate time frame]


For example: 


“This is going to be 4 steps to get you from having zero control on your sales calls to a consistent 30% closing ratio in about 8 weeks time” 


Step 7: Create A Short Explanation For Your Pillars


Get an idea of how you’re going to explain each pillars using the two formulas given in the training: 


* Formula #1 (easier)
   * Good if you don’t have the prospects language to use
   * Feature —> Logical Benefit —> Emotional Benefit —> (Optional: Consequence)
   * Tie down
   * Ex: 
      * The final step we’ll take is to start hiring you sales reps so that you don’t have to take all the calls yourself anymore and you can start working on the business, not in the business, which will ultimately allow you to have that sense of freedom in which you can go on a week long vacation without a laptop attached to your side. 
      * Does that make sense? 
      * Any questions or thoughts on that or are you ready to move onto ___


* Formula #2
   * Same as formula #1 but the lead in is different when you have the prospects language about their logical/emotional pain. 
      * You know how you told me… [logical pain]
      * And it’s making you feel…[emotional pain] 
      * Well what we do here is [deliverable/how it works]
      * So that you can have [logical benefit]
      * Which will allow you to [emotional benefit]
      * Tie Down “Make sense?”
      * (Optional: And the reason why this is so important is that [consequence of not having pillar] 
   * Ex:
      * So you know how earlier on the call you mentioned you were stuck in the day to day sales and it was making you feel like you had a job instead of a business? 
      * Well, once we get the first three pillars down, the last thing we’ll do is start to put the right systems in place to bring on your first few sales reps so that you don’t have to take all the calls yourself anymore and you can start working on the business, not in the business, which will ultimately allow you to have that sense of freedom in which you can go on a week long vacation without a laptop attached to your side. 
      * (Conseqeuence) And the most important part about this - is finding the right sales reps to begin with. Sales reps are the most expensive hire in your business. For instance - it’ll take about 30 calls to see what a closers true closing percentage is, and if your offer is say - 5k - that’s literally staking 150k worth of business on someone you don’t even know is going to pan out. So the real key to this is actually being able to vet the reps on the front end and only hire the ones that have the highest probability to succeed - does that make sense? 


Step 8: Narrow Down Which Deliverables You’ll Present


List out all the ways you support your clients in getting from current → desired situation (i.e training, 1o1, group, call reviews, voxer, events, etc…)


Once listed, narrow down the most important 2-3 (you want them to be the most compelling but also give the prospect certainty that you’ll deliver). 


Step 9: Make Your Deliverables Benefit-Rich


List out the benefits and “benefits of the benefits” of each deliverable. 


Also - list out the consequence of NOT having the deliverable


Example: 


And on top of that you’ll have 1o1 access to me M-F 9-5 through voxer, so that I can coach you on the spot on the day you have calls. 


Plus, that way if you go into a slump… I can break you out of it within a day opposed to you having to wait 4-7 days til our next clinic. 


Step 10: Create Your Pitch Structure And Memorize


Now we have all the parts, so take each part and put it in order. 


High Level Promise
Pillars & Explanation
Support/Delivery


Once you have this laid out, you want to practice it OUT LOUD dozens of times and rewrite it to be in your own dialect. 


When you’re on the calls, you SHOULD NOT have to read this word for word. You should be able to just look at the first few words and know the rest - and then be able to “on the fly” tailor it to the prospect situation.

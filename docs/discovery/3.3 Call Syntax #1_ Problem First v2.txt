Reminders Before We Get Going...
* We’ve already learned the 7 beliefs:
   * Pain
   * Doubt
   * Cost
   * Desire
   * Money
   * Support
   * Trust (Method)
      * Solution Questions 
* Remember, you have two goals on the call: 
   * Find out if/how you can help them
   * Eliminate objections before the close
      * If you check the boxes of these 7 beliefs, you do that by default.
* While you can cover these 7 beliefs in ANY ORDER (free flow - socratic dialogue) there is a preferred syntax I use.
   * Why? Because if you go in a certain order, things will tend to build on each other. And you can frame it in a way where when you’re asking the more serious questions (Cost questions for example) you have more context to ask them from
      * Permission → Context → Question

Questions // Scripting Breakdown:


Isolate The Problem(s):
What’s the biggest challenge right now? Or what’s not working at the level it truly could be or that it should? 


(We want to stay here until we know what the problem is. Once we find it, we put our shovel in the ground and start digging). You can also ask - asides from that, is there any other challenge or roadblock that’s in the way right now? To see if there’s additional before moving on…


Background Questions:
This part is very simple. You just ask whatever basic questions you need to know to understand the context of their situation. 


For example, if you’re selling b2b, you’ll probably ask: 
* What’s your offer?
* How is that priced? What are the terms on the pricing?
* Who is your ideal customer? 
* What’s your sales process like? How does a stranger become a paying customer a → z? 


For example, if you’re selling to real estate agents, you’ll probably ask: 
* What’s the average home price in the markets you’re currently in? 
* Do you prefer listings or buyers? 
* What type of client is your perfect client? What type of leads would you like to be getting consistently? 
* What’s your commission? 5 or 6%?
* Do you have a split with the broker? 80/20? 


Think about it this way… all you’re doing here is getting the necessary information so that you can 
1. Get full context on their business before diving into the problem
2. Understand if it’s a business you can actually help


FYI - in most b2c offers (biz opp, health, dating, etc) you don’t need to do this part. 
Current Situation:
* Probing (Referencing The Isolated Problem) 
   * Tell me more. What do you mean when you say ___ 
   * Why do you say that’s the biggest challenge? 
      * How has that impacted the business specifically?
         * How else has it impacted the business? 
* Assess Current Efforts: 
   * Gotcha… so what are you currently doing to try to ____ right now?
      * Examples: 
         * What are you currently doing to generate leads right now? 
         * What are you currently doing to try to meet women right now? 
         * What is your diet like right now? What is your exercise routine currently? 
      * Here… all we’re doing is trying to see what are they doing NOW to fix the problem, if anything. 
* Chunking Down:  
   * Ok, great… so let’s see how that’s working out for you… last month… how many new appointments did you have with new potential clients? 
      * Got it. Now, what about the month before? 
      * Ok… so about 3 in the last 2 months…
         * How many of those are that perfect client, specifically? 
         * And out of those, how many did you enroll into a paying client? 
            * 1-2. 
         * And at what price point was that? 
         * And is that what you want to be charging? Or what do you really want to be charging? 
   * Ok… so is 6k your total revenue for the past 2 months? Or what’s your total revenue? 
      * 5k last month. Now, is that gross or is that net? 
         * 2k. 
* How Long
   * Gotcha so… how long has this been going on for? 
      * “How long have has your lead gen been like this?”
      * “How long has your dating life been this way?” 
* Widen The Gap
B2B + B2C Examples...
* 3 years… wow, I mean… has that had an impact on you?
   * In what way though?
* Has this impacted other areas of your business? In what way though? 
* Does that put you in a tough spot with (insert other area of life)
   * Given you’re working 80 hours a week… does that put you in a tough spot with working out and maintaining your health? 
   * Considering you’ve been doing paycheck to paycheck for the past 3 years… has that put you in a tough position with your family? 
* I sense you might be frustrated by that… (statement) 
* What’s the worst part about ____?
B2C Examples
* Does this impact your body confidence? 
   * Like on a scale of 1-10… 1 being “I’m not satisfied at all” and 10 being feeing like I could be on the cover of SI, where do you feel like you’re at?
      * What does a “3” mean to you specifically? 
         * Does this affect your self-esteem? In what way though? 
         * Can I ask you a personal question? Does this impact intimacy with your partner? And things in the bedroom? In what way? 
* Does this impact your level of energy? 
   * Scale of 1-10 with 10 being you feel like you could run the NY marathon and 1 being it’s definitely impacting it where do you feel like you’re at? 
      * What does a “4” mean to you specifically?
         * Can I ask you an honest question? Does that impact things at work? In what way? 
* Doubt: 
   * Can I ask you an honest question? What’d you think has been keeping you from figuring this out on your own? What’s in the way?
* Solution Questions
   * Have you reached out to anyone else to get help with this in the past? 
   * Are you working with anyone now?
   * Have you been out there considering other coaches to possibly work with two?
   * Have you done coaching before? 
* Cost / Why Now
   * Syntax I usually do:
      * How long has this been a problem for you? 
      * What have you tried to fix this in the past, if anything? 
      * Two scenarios:
         * They’ve tried nothing
         * They’ve tried a bunch of stuff
      * (If they’ve tried nothing)
         * Can I ask you a personal question? So… you’ve been wanting to leave your 9-5 for about 3 years now and you’re finally reaching out to do something about it…I’m curious, but why all the sudden is this important now, though? What shifted for you? What happened? 
            * Is there any other reason that this is important now though? 
         * That makes sense. Can I ask you another question? And, I really hate to ask this, but what’s your plan if nothing changes? If you’re still doing the 9-5 3 years from now? 
            * Would that have an impact on you? In what way? 
            * Yeah but, why now though? 
            * (if they give an apathetic response) well whos decision is that? 
               * Are you willing to settle for that? 
               * Why not though? 
               * (Last chance) if you’re willing to settle for where you’re at, how do you expect me to help you then as a client? 
      * (if they’ve tried EVERYTHING - more scripting here)
         * Wow, ok… Can I ask you a personal question? After all of that… after spending six figure over 2 years… trying 5-7 different programs that didn’t work… I mean, I’m curious - what has you keeping on, keepin on? What about getting this business to 7-figures is so important to you? 
            * Why now though? 
            * How else would that impact you? 
            * Is there any other reason that this is important?
* (Support Questions) 
   * Biz Partner
      * What does the leadership structure of your company look like? 
      * Who’s in charge of what? How do you divvy responsibilities? 
      * What does ____ think of (the problem)? 
         * Are you guys on the same page? 
         * Does he know you’re on this call? 
         * What would he think if he knew you were on this call? 
   * Spouse
      * Are you married?
      * What’d you wife think about this transition/change?
      * Is she supportive? 
      * Does she know you are on this call?
      * What would she think if she did? 


Desired Situation:
* Gotcha, so if you’re able to figure out your (lead generation)… then ultimately, what’s the goal? 
   * Probing questions (Tell me more, why is that important, etc) 
* And what’s your monetary goal? 
   * You seemed like you’ve thought of that number before… can I ask, why that number? 
* (Financial Qualifier) And how much money would you have to have just to REPLACE the amount of income that you’re making full time? 
   * Is that ultimately the goal? To transition out of that? 
   * Is replacing enough to allow you to leave? Or how much would you have to be bringing in to be able to walk in the door in put in those 2wks? 
      * (COVID-19) - Has that been impacted by COVID? In what way? 
         * Given the drop in income.. Has that put you in a tough position financially? In what way? 
* And overall, what’s your long-term vision for ____? 
   * Probing questions (again) 
* Now, can I ask a personal question? And the reason why I’m asking is because my goal isn’t only to build you a business that’s building you wealth - but also one that’s empowering you to live whatever lifestyle that you want to live. So when you - think about - what that is for you… what comes up? What are the non-monetary goals - the personal goals - that you want your business to allow you to achieve? 


Tie Down Discovery


Gotcha well I feel like we covered quite a bit of ground here…


Is there anything at all that you feel like we haven’t covered, that you feel like I need to know? 


Transition Phase


Here you’re going to use the basic transition or pre-pitch, etc…


Right before you go into your core pitch, you have ANOTHER opportunity to temperature check timing as well as spouse/partner (if you haven’t already) 


* Let's pretend, for a moment you were to go ahead with something that would (fix problem)... 
   * In order for most of my clients to get to ____ (result), they typically need about 10 hours a week. Is that something you’d be willing and able to potentially commit to right now? 
* In the case that we’d be working together, would your spouse/partner potentially be involved? 
   * Can reschedule at that point (see support questions training)

What Is Call Syntax #2?
* We’ve already learned the 7 beliefs:
   * Pain
   * Doubt
   * Cost
   * Desire
   * Money
   * Support
   * Trust (Method)
      1. Solution Questions 
* Remember, you have two goals on the call: 
   * Find out if/how you can help them
   * Eliminate objections before the close
      1. If you check the boxes of these 7 beliefs, you do that by default.
* While you can cover these 7 beliefs in ANY ORDER (free flow - socratic dialogue) there is a preferred syntax I use.
   * Why? Because if you go in a certain order, things will tend to build on each other. And you can frame it in a way where when you’re asking the more serious questions (Cost questions for example) you have more context to ask them from
      1. Permission → Context → Question 
* (See info gathering flow for deeper dive into specific questions) 


When to use Call Syntax #2:
* I would ALWAYS start off with call syntax #1. Then you’re going to default to #2 when one of the following happens:
   * This is a “new opportunity” for the prospect 
      1. New business for example
   * They don’t know how to diagnose their problem
      1. They give you the wrong problem (“finishing my website”)
         * Majoring in the minors 
      2. They tell you “I don’t where to start” 
   * They are confused
      1. Defaulting to… “So what do you want” is the easiest way to cut through a lack of clarity. 
   * They are using the wrong “method” that doesn’t align with your solution
      1. I.e - you ask about problems, and they start telling you about how they are stuck trying to make a low ticket product (when you teach high ticket).

Questions // Scripting Breakdown:


Isolate the challenge:


What’s the biggest challenge right now? Or what’s not working at the level it truly could be or that it should? 


(They respond with one of our above criteria that indicate we should switch to goals) 


Desired Situation:


* Gotcha, well what might make more sense is to begin with the end in mind here… so ultimately, what’s the goal? 
   * Probing questions (Tell me more, why is that important, etc) 
* And what’s your monetary goal? 
   * You seemed like you’ve thought of that number before… can I ask, why that number? 
* (Financial Qualifier) And how much money would you have to have just to REPLACE the amount of income that you’re making full time? 
   * Is that ultimately the goal? To transition out of that? 
   * Is replacing enough to allow you to leave? Or how much would you have to be bringing in to be able to walk in the door in put in those 2wks? 
      * (COVID-19) - Has that been impacted by COVID? In what way? 
         * Given the drop in income.. Has that put you in a tough position financially? In what way? 
* And overall, what’s your long-term vision for ____? 
   * Probing questions (again) 
* Now, can I ask a personal question? And the reason why I’m asking is because my goal isn’t only to build you a business that’s building you wealth - but also one that’s empowering you to live whatever lifestyle that you want to live. So when you - think about - what that is for you… what comes up? What are the non-monetary goals - the personal goals - that you want your business to allow you to achieve? 


Current Situation: 


* Now, what’d you do now for work full time? 
   * Do you like it? (This presents us two options)
      * They don’t like it (and then you use probing questions to dig into the pain 
         * “what’s the worst part about that?” “Take me back to the day where you said… “enough is enough” what happened?”)
         * How long have you been doing it? And how long have you been thinking about starting this business? 
            * Can I ask you a personal question? After all that time… what was the final straw? Like what made you draw the line in the sand and say - you know what - this has got to become a priority now, though? 
      * They do like it… and then you say:
         * What’d you like about it? 
         * And how long have you been doing that for? And how long have you thought about starting this? 
         * Wow… well can I ask you a personal question? After doing that for 5 years… and it all going fairly well for you… I mean… why all the sudden do you want to stop doing that and start this business? Like… what happened.. To make this a priority for you now, though? 
   * (Doubt) What’d you think has been the biggest challenge in getting this started by yourself? What’s in the way? 
   * (Solution Questions) 
      * Have you reached out to anyone else to get help with this in the past? 
      * Are you working with anyone now?
      * Have you been out there considering other coaches to possibly work with two?
      * Have you done coaching before? 
   * (Support Questions) Are you married?
      * What’d you wife think about this transition?
      * Is she supportive? 
      * Does she know you are on this call?
      * What would she think if she did?

Outline Keys To Success: 


This is where you want to outline the 1-3 things they need to be successful at whatever this new opportunity is. And then you see where they’re at with both of thus. This will both:
1. Build you as the authority
2. Provide them insight
3. And create doubt (because they’re not going to have it) 


So can I give you a little coaching for a second? 


In order to be able to scale a coaching business to 20k/m (even 100k/m) you only need TWO things: 

1. A desirable and scalable offer
2. A way to get clients for that offer. 


That’s it. Those are the main two things we need to focus on to get to 20k/m. Make sense? 


Great, so let’s dive into each…


In terms of your offer, do you have an idea of what that looks like now? 
* Who:
* What (Promise):
   * Is the who/what it specific? If not, you can coach this. 
* How (Delivery): 
   * Is this leverageable? If not, you can coach on this (pre-pitch) 
* (Temp Checks)
   * Are you open minded to potentially rearranging your offer a bit if it meant a faster and less time intensive way of getting to 20k/m?
   * Have you considered (your method) 
      * Ex: Have you considered packaging that into a coaching offer and charging 3k? Instead of 97? 


Got it now, let’s just suppose we invite you in and help you build out this offer from scratch…


To where now, you’re 100% clear and 100% certain in the offer part of the process specifically. 


Now, if that were the case… would you have a dialed in system where you can basically pull the lever and get new people coming in? Or is that something you’d potentially need help building out… 


(They are always gonna say: “I would need help with that”) 


Transition: 


Gotcha well I feel like we’ve covered quite a bit…


Is there anything else you feel like we didn’t cover (regarding your biz, goals, etc) that we should? 


Then move onto pre-pitch…


You also have the option to temperature check timing commitment and spouse/partner again (to reposition for 2-call close) if needed.

Pain Questions (Part 1 - Isolate Problem):


* When do we use? 
   * Beginning of the call
* What are we looking for? 
   * A clear problem. 
      * I.e “my biggest challenge is generating leads”
      * I’m stuck working in my business right now with a ton of fulfillment
      * I can’t close the deals we have 
      * I’ve been stuck / yo-yo-ing with my weight forever now… 
* Pain questions we start the call with: 
   * What’s your biggest challenge right now? 
   * What’s not working in your business right now? 
   * Where are you stuck right now? 
   * Where do you need help specifically right now? 
* (if you get a response along the lines of “everything is fine just wanna see what you do”...reverse engineer)
   * Great… so what exactly are you trying to accomplish in business/life right now?
      * What’d you need to get there ASAP? 
      * What’s the biggest reason you’re not already there? 
         * (if time) - so what’s keeping you from getting there faster? 
   * What’s your goal, ultimately? 
      * Same follow up questions as above
   * Two Truths
      * How are you generating leads right now? (background question) 
      * Great, so that is working well for you? 
      * Awesome - well sounds like that’s going, fairly well, for you… Just curious, but, what would you change about that, if you could? 
         * Why would you change that though? 
            * But why is that important to you now though? 
         * Is there anything else you would change? 


Pain Questions (Part 2 - Widening The Gap)


* When do we use? 
   * After we isolated pain
* What are we looking for? 
   * You fully understand the problem. (general probing) 
   * You’ve understood the full context / severity of problem (widen the gap) 
   * You understand what the problem is keeping them from getting (need payoff) 
   * You’ve attached clear numbers to the problem (chunking down // financial) 
* #1 General Probing Questions: 
   * Tell me more
   * Did I just hear you say ____
   * (Repeat last three words phrases as question) 
   * What do you mean? 
   * So ___ is the biggest challenge… why do you say that? 
   * Why is that important now though? 
   * So aside from ____ is there anything else you would change about your situation, if you could? 
   * What’s bothering you most about this? 
   * Has that put you in a tough position? 
      * In what way? 
   * Process question (doubt):
      * Do you feel like you have a process in which you can pull the lever and get new clients coming in at will? 
      * Do you feel like you have a process that if you follow it, you know with certainty you’ll be able to lose weight? 
      * ** designed to get them to say “no” 
   * How long has this been going on for? 
   * What’d you think has been keeping you from figuring this out on your own? (doubt) 
   * KEY NOTES
      * These questions parlay well into DOUBT, BACKGROUND, SOLUTION questions.  
* #2 Chunking Down Questions (Questions To Turn Stories Into Numbers)
   * What are you currently/using doing? (background question) 
      * How are you currently generating leads?
      * How are you currently getting dates with girls? 
   * Let’s find out how that’s working for you… last week, how many appointment did you have with new potential clients? 
      * Week before?
      * Last month? 
      * Month before? (go back 2-4 weeks or 2-3 months depending on context) 
      * What % of leads were quality? 
      * How many did you close? 
         * Low conversion rate (duplicate) 
            * Sales process vs Quality. 
      * For ROI offers… you’ll want to go into finances too. 
   * For weight loss
      * What’d you weight now? 
      * 3mo ago? 
      * Last year? 
      * 3 years ago? 
   * For dating
      * How many dates did you go on last week? 
         * How many dates actually turned into something steady or serious? 
            * Low conversion rate (duplicate) 
               * Quality of dates vs not connecting 
      * Week before? 
      * Last month? 
      * Month before?
      * When’s the last time you had a girlfriend? 
      * How many girlfriends have you had? 
   * KEY NOTES
      * These naturally lead into FINANCIAL questions and sometimes COST questions.  
* #3 Questions To Widen The Gap
   * How is that impacting other areas of your business?
      * In what way? 
   * Does that put you in a tough spot with (insert other area of life)
      * Given you’re working 80 hours a week… does that put you in a tough spot with working out and maintaining your health? 
      * Considering you’ve been doing paycheck to paycheck for the past 3 years… has that put you in a tough position with your family? 
   * In what ways does (problem) show up in (other areas of life) 
      * In what ways does bodyweight impact your relationships with men and your sex life? 
      * Other than the obvious ones, in what ways does inconsistent lead flow impact the growth for the company and your vision for it overall? 
   * How has this impacted other areas of your life? 
      * In what way? 
   * I sense you might be frustrated by that… (statement) 
   * What’s the worst part about ____?
   * On a scale of 1-10, 10 being you literally hit your life’s potential and can’t do any better, 1 being your not even close ; how close are you to fulfilling your potential/legacy?
      * Why do you say that though? 
   * KEY NOTES
      * These often lead into COST questions and SPOUSE/PARTNER questions.
* #3.5 Need-Payoff Questions
   * Ultimately, if you were able to X, what would that open you up to do? 
      * If you were able to generate 5 quality leads per day consistently and predictably… what would that do/change for the business? 
      * If you were able to cut the time your spending in fulfillment by 100% - meaning completely get rid of it - what would that open you up to do in your business? 
      * When you say ___, what do you mean by that specifically?  
         * I,e Freedom / financial abundance / security / impact 
   * You solving this problem, how would your (life/business) be different than it is now? 
      * How would that make you feel? 
   * Let’s just pretend you were able to (solve problem // have result) would that have an impact on you? In what way, though? 
      * Let’s just pretend you were able to generate about 25 high quality leads a week… what impact would that have on the business? 
   * What would that do for you personally? 
   * And (beyond business) would have an impact on you personally as well? In what way, though? 
   * KEY NOTES 
      * These questions paylay well into VISION. 


*** Once you isolate the pain, the call will become very free flow. 


The key is to LISTEN to what they’re saying and utilize it to ask questions to check off the 9 parts of the call. 


Since the skilled questions you’re asking are based on what they’re already saying, it demonstrates your listening and that is HUGE for trust & authority.  


Background Questions


* When do we use? 
   * Near the beginning of the call
* What’s the purpose of these questions // what are we looking for? 
   * To understand the logistics of if/how we can help the prospect
   * To identify any friction between their current situation vs your offer
      * I.e low ticket offer for a sales course. 
   * We can also use these to “ease in” to more invasive questions and the pain 
* Background Questions
   * What are you selling? 
      * Different levels? 
   * What’s your price point?
      * Collection % UF? Payment plans?  
   * Who’s your target market? Perfect client? 
   * So there is a lot of companies out there offering something similar - what exactly are you doing with your marketing right now to help you stand out as unique, different, and superior, if anything?
   * What’s the promise of your product / service? 
   * What are you currently using/doing now for (X)
      * How are you currently generating leads right now? 
      * How is the fulfillment handled in your business right now? 
      * What is your current sales process like right now? A--Z?
   * Who are you currently using for (X) now…?
      * I.e Who are you currently outsourcing lead generation to right now? 
   * What got you involved in….? 
      * What got you involved in wanting to start an online coaching business? 
         * What are you currently doing now for work though?
            * Do you like anything about it?
            * What don’t you like about it? 
            * What makes you want to transition into this full time? 
            * Why now though? 
            * (***not background questions but so you can see how this works…)
         * What have you tried to launch this business so far? 
         * What’s been the biggest struggle with it so far? 
      * What got you involved in wanting to transition into a vegan plant based diet?
   * What type of ___ are you ___
      * What type of CRM system are you using to track your teams pipeline right now? 
         * You could use two truths here… for ex. 
      * What type of products are you selling the most of right now?
* Questions To “Temp” For Change
   * If it were possible to…. So that you could… is that something you’d be open to?
      * Well why though? 
   * If it were possible to repackage your low ticket course and bolt on some 1o1 or even group support so that you could increase your price from 997 to 10k, is that something you’d be open to? 
      * Well why though? 
   * If there was a way you could systematize the back-end of your fulfillment so that you could take more of a CEO role opposed to a techinician role - so that something you’d be open to pursuing? 
      * Well why though? 
   * Have you considered… 
      * Have you considered bolting on group support to your program so that you could increase the price by 3-5x which will ultimately fix the issue with your margins? 


Doubt Questions


* When do we use? 
   * After we’ve isolated the challenge
   * Best when we’ve found out what that challenge is keeping them from achieving (so after “need-payoff” type questions. 
* What’s the purpose? What are we looking for? 
   * To eliminate DIY objections and get prospect to acknowledge they can’t figure it out on their own. 
   * We are looking for:
      * A) They don’t know how
      * B) They want to leverage a proven system so they can get there faster without while wasting less resources (time/money). 
* Key distinction:
   * Isolate doubt on the PAIN not the GOAL
      * For ex: “gotcha so inconsistent lead flow is keeping you from having the cash flow necessary to be able to hire on a team and ultimately scale your business to 100k/m… do I have that correct? 
      * So if lead gen is the biggest bottle neck in getting to 100k/m… I mean, what’s been stopping you from figuring that out on your own? 
      * Opposed to… “What’ stopping you from getting to 100k/m on your own” 
* Questions:
   * Main question: 
      * So if (isolated challenge) is the biggest thing stopping you from getting to (need pay off / goal)… what’s been keeping you from figuring that out on your own? 
   * If this question DOES NOT give you the outcomes we’re looking for (see above) ask this:
      * Gotcha so just to get further clarity here, typically what I’ve found is there is 1 or 2 reasons that client reach out: 
         * It’s either 1) there’s a “knowledge gap” in other words, they don’t know what they don’t know because they’ve never done it. 
         * Or 2) they know they could probably figure it out… but like any real entrepreneur they want to leverage a proven system to get there faster so that they don’t waste as much time and money trying to figure it out on their own…
      * Which one (if not both) of those do you feel like you fall into? 
      * Gotcha - and why do you say that? 
   * Other ways to create doubt (use for ppl heavy with EGO: 
      * Chunking down (above) 
      * Yes/No Questions (+ questions to follow up) - USE THESE ON THE ISOLATED CHALLENGES & FUTURE PROBLEMS. 
         * Do you have a predictable process in which you can call on and get new clients coming in at will? 
            * Do you know how to put such a process in place or is that exactly what you’re on the phone looking for help with? 
         * Do you have any systems or clear SOPs built out to where if we hire an employee tomorrow, you can plug them in and they know exactly what to do? 
         * Do you have any sort of predictable strategy that if you follow exactly, you know you’ll start getting consistent dates with the women you really like? 
         * Suppose that we invite you in and build out a consistent organic acquisition strategy so that you can get to 20k/m without any ad spend… Once we get you there - do you know how to implement a paid ads strategy that will allow you to scale profitably? Or is that something else you would need help with? 
            * Gotcha and once we got you scale up with paid, would you have clear SOPs to where we can literally hire people and plug them right into your company so that we can take stuff off your plate? Or are those things that you’d need to model from our systems and processes? 


Finances & Resources


* When do we use? 
   *  As we “widen the gap” and go deeper into the pain, we will have opportunities to naturally lead into this. 
* What’s the purpose? What are we looking for? 
   * 1) Are they able? 
      * Are you 80% sure finances won’t be an issue? (guy with no business waiting tables vs guy doing 20k/m) 
   * 2) Are they willing to allocate those resources fix the pain? (lifestyle aka non-ROI offers)  
   * 3) Establish a clear “data point” for their current situation 
      * 225lbs (if they’re overweight and want to lose) 
      * 7k/m 
      * 0-1 dates a month and no relationship (if they want to get more dates and have a girlfriend)  
* Key Distinctions
   * Do not let digging into financials become a “self-fulfilling prophecy”. It’s a paradox. If you’re digging into finances with the belief “this guy probably has no money” he will put his guard up and admit he has no money. Best way to do this is by being genuinely concerned and going deeper based on what he/she already told you...
      * (i.e his income is 4k/m and expenses are 3500/m and he’s living paycheck to paycheck - makes sense to go deeper) 
* Financial Questions (+ data point questions) 
   * What’d you currently do for work? (if not an ROI / business offer)
   * (for non-ROI offer - set a data point)
      * How much do you weigh currently? 
         * How does that compare to 3mo ago? A year ago? 3 years ago? 
   * ROI-Offers (if they’re working full time): How much do you need to bring in to REPLACE your current income doing ____ 
   * How much money do you make from your business right now? 
      * Is that gross or net? 
      * Gotcha what is that after expenses? 
      * How much do you leave in the business vs pay yourself? 
      * And then after taxes that’s…? 
      * Gotcha and do you use that just to support yourself or do you have a family as well?
         * (Dig into rather he/she has a spouse who supports the household income) 
      * So based on what you pay yourself… how much is left over after your monthly expenses for you to put away and save? 
      * Can I ask you an honest question? Are you satisfied with that? 
         * Yeah? In what way does that impact you? 
         * Does that impact any other area’s of your life? 
         * How long have you been making that amount of money? Well, Why not just stay where you are though?
         * How much longer can you sustain this amount of (revenue//income))? 
         * Can I ask you a personal question? And I really hate to ask this but… What’s your plan if say, 6mo goes by and nothing changes? And you’re still month to month?
            * (if “I definitely gotta change”) Well, why now though? 
            * (if “I guess I’d be in the same spot) And whose decision is that, ultimately? 
               * Are you willing to settle for that? 
* Resources & Willingness Questions (use if you get a red flag about their finances)
   * If NON-ROI // LIFESTYLE OFFER
      * Can I ask you an honest question? Are you willing to invest in yourself financially to fix (pain) so that you can ultimately (what they want?)
      * If you look at the most successful people in the world - they have one thing in common: they’re willing to invest in mentors so that they can get the support in building the SKILLS and mindset to be able to achieve what they want. So when it comes to achieving (what they want) so if you’re not willing to invest in yourself to get the skills and the pieces of the puzzle that you’re missing - how WILL you get there? 
   * ROI Offers: 
      * Can I ask you a personal question about your finances? Look - and the reason I’m asking, is I’m not here to just determine IF working with (us) is the best fit for you, but even if it is WHEN - and TIMING is predicated on a lot of things, one of which of those things IS finances - so are you open to having an honest conversation about where you’re at financially and based on that we can figure out what the best way to help you is? 
         * Awesome - so starting with Cash on hand - where is that at exactly right now? 
         * Gotcha - and cash flow is ultimately the life blood of your business. So in a lot of cases, it’s important we protect that. So let me ask you, do you have access to credit to fund your business? 
   * IF THEY GET DEFENSIVE - 
      * Example: look and the reason I’m asking you is to find the best route for you to achieve your goal. We have some clients come in and based on their finances, go straight to paid advertising. Other clients, we have them leverage organic so they can fund their own paid ads. It really just depends, make sense? 
      * Right and even if you can’t do this now - my goal for you worst case scenario is to create a GAME PLAN for you to work towards in the future. 
   * IF THEY HAVE NO MONEY: 
      * Gotcha so I understand finances are tight right now, but the real issue isn’t your lack of finances. The real issue is always going to be lack of resourcefulness….
         * So given where we’re at right now, how do you think you can get resourceful in funding your business? 
         * Are you really willing to let money get in the way of you having (insert what they want?)
            * Then how can you get resourceful to make this work? 


Solution Questions


* When do we use? 
   * After we’ve isolated pain
   * (preferably) After we know how long they’ve been experiencing said pain. 
   * If they bring up things they’ve tried in the past… 
* What’s the purpose? What are we looking for? 
   * What have they tried in the past to fix what they said the challenge/problem is? 
      * Have they tried similar solutions to the one you have to offer? 
   * Are they shopping? (i.e I’m either going to work with (competitor) or you)
   * Ultimately, we want to find out what have they tried in the past to solve this particular challenge, why it didn’t work, what they liked, didn’t like, and so on so that we can position our solution as exactly what they are looking for. 
      * The explanation of our solution (our pitch) should explain why everything they tried in the past didn’t work and why this is going to be different simultaneously 
* Key Distinctions
   * I typically like to use these questions AFTER I get through pain / background / doubt / finances and BEFORE consequence. They’re usually a good segueway into getting associated with the cost/”why now” (more on this in the next video) 
   * If they haven’t tried anything to fix this problem in the past, you can check this part off the list and dig into why (this will paylay into consequence/why now)  
* Core Questions 
   * How long have you been trying to fix XYZ? 
      * What have you tried to fix this in the past, if anything? 
      * Before finding us, have you been out there looking for anything else that would give you what you’re wanting here? 
      * Aside from speaking with me, have you been out there looking for (similar products) that would (solve problem)?
         * Have you been out there looking into any other sales coaches that could help you bring on a few more sales reps?  
      * When it comes to getting help… what exactly do you feel like you need? 
         * How do you know when you’ll have found something that’s a fit? 
         * Anything else you’re looking for in a ____ (i.e a lead provider)
      * Have you ever (done similar product) before? 
         * Have you ever had a coach before? 
* If they’ve tried things to fix the problem in the past, use these questions…
   * What was your experience with what you tried? 
      * Two truths (see above) 
   * What was the difference between what was PROMISED to you, and what actually happened? 
   * If you could go back in time, what do you WISH you would of asked that salesperson before hopping into the program/offer? 
   * How was the result supposed to be delivered? (was this a course? DFY? DWY?) 
   * Did other clients get results in that program?
      * Why didn’t you think you did? 
   * What we’ve found, is anytime you enroll into something and don’t get the results… it’s 1 of 3 things:
      * The system taught was ineffective / out of date 
      * What we being taught was good - but there was a lot of difficulty taking very GENERAL information, and actually getting SUPPORT to implement it and execute it successfully for your specific situation 
      * OR - the coach was good, other students were getting results and you didn’t show up. 
      * Which one of those three do you think it was? 
         * Why do you say that? 
   * Ask questions to see if they received the benefits your program provides (for ex, mine below). 
      * Did you actually get to speak with anyone or get support in that program? Or was it just a course with maybe email support tops?  
      * Did you actually get any 1o1 help? Or were you just thrown into a Facebook group with really crowded group calls? 
      * When you had a question, how quickly did you get a response? 
      * Did they actually listen to and review your sales calls? How many? 
      * Was there any resources / training / material to go through? Or was it just 1o1 coaching sessions? 
      * Did they teach you any strategies on post-call conversion? Like how to re-covert people who didn’t close on the first call? 
      * Did they help you get clarity on how to structure your offer so when you explain it over the phone it’s compelling? 
      * Did they actually teach you the psychology behind sales? Or did you just get a script with a 2hr long video and that was about the extent of the sales training? 
      * Did they teach you the psychology behind objections and give you proven frameworks to handle them? Or did you just memorize a bunch of canned rebuttals? 
      * Was there any information on how to hire / onboard / train and manage sales reps so that you can replace yourself from sales? 


Cost Questions


* When do we use? 
   * Works best after we’ve “widened the gap” (Pain Part 2) 
   * I like to set it up using solution questions (see below) 
* What’s the purpose? What are we looking for? 
   * A compelling reason why they have to change now
   * Clear consequences of doing nothing
   * “Ammo” for you to hold them accountable at the close. 
* Key Distinctions
   * Works better if we ask permission before
      * “Can I ask you another question?”
      * Can I ask you a personal question?” 
   * 90% I do after solution questions (see below) OR when talking about finances. 
   * Other 10% of the time they just bring up stuff that allows me to dig into it. 
   * Finding the MOMENT of decision is most powerful. 
* Syntax I usually use: 
   * Syntax I usually do:
      * How long has this been a problem for you? 
      * What have you tried to fix this in the past, if anything? 
      * Two scenarios:
         * They’ve tried nothing
         * They’ve tried a bunch of stuff
      * (If they’ve tried nothing)
         * Can I ask you a personal question? So… you’ve been wanting to leave your 9-5 for about 3 years now and you’re finally reaching out to do something about it…I’m curious, but why all the sudden is this important now, though? Why not stay where you’re are? 
            * Is there any other reason that this is important and you don’t want to stay where you’re at? 
         * That makes sense. Can I ask you another question? And, I really hate to ask this, but what’s your plan if nothing changes? If you’re still doing the 9-5 3 years from now? 
            * Would that have an impact on you? In what way? 
            * Yeah but, why now though? 
            * (if they give an apathetic response) well whos decision is that? 
               * Are you willing to settle for that? 
               * Why not though? 
               * (Last chance) if you’re willing to settle for where you’re at, how do you expect me to help you then as a client? 
      * (if they’ve tried EVERYTHING - more scripting here)
         * Wow, ok… Can I ask you a personal question? After all of that… after spending six figure over 2 years… trying 5-7 different programs that didn’t work… I mean, I’m curious - what has you keeping on, keepin on? What about getting this business to 7-figures is so important to you? 
            * Why now though? 
            * How else would that impact you? 
            * Is there any other reason that this is important? 
* “Why now” questions:
   * Can I ask you an honest question? Why not stay where you are, though?
      * Well are you willing to settle for that, though? 
   * Why even bother with this? 
   * What about ___ is important to you? 
   * Why is that important to you now, though? 
      * And how would that make you feel? 
      * How would it feel to be able to do that? 
   * How important is it for you to fix this? 
      * Why do you say that though? 
      * Why now, though? 
   * What shifted for you? Was there a moment where “enough was enough”? To where you decided that staying where you were was no longer tolerable? 
* “Cost / Consequence” questions 
   * Can I ask you an honest question? And I hate to ask this, but what are you doing to do if nothing changes? If you keep doing the same thing for the next 3-5 years? 
   * What are you going to do if the next 3 years are like the last three years?
      * Would that have an impact on you? In what way though? 
   * Can I challenge you for a second here? And the reason I'm asking you this is because I don't only want to get your clear on your goals and your vision so we know how to get there, but also - as any great leader would - I want to challenge you to look at stake here too… so what’re you going to do if _____ (cost question)? 
   * What if it didn’t work out for you? 
   * Have you considered what would happen if a year goes by and nothing changes? 
   * Have you thought of what would happen if you don’t do anything about this? 
   * Have you considered what would happen if that program doesn’t get you the results that you want? 
   * What if what you’re using/doing now doesn’t work? 
      * (it has to) Why though? What are the possible ramifications if it didn’t? 
   * What if your situation gets even worse? 
* THE FOURTH WALL (if they’re not playing ball) (cred to brad newman) 
   * Look can I be super honest with you? 
   * Are you sure? Because look I know exactly what makes our most successful clients crush it and exactly what you need to do to fix this but it’s probably not gonna be what you want to hear but what you need to hear. 
   * Your vision and your reasons aren’t inspiring the me at all (pause) 
   * Look I appreciate you and acknowledge you for ____ (find something here) 
   * But I am NOT inspired by your vision and quite frankly I do NOT know why you do what you do. 
   * And I get what you’re probably thinking - why does that matter? 
   * Here’s why - when you’re doing anything great in business there’s literally no guarantees - except for the fact that there’s going to be challenges. There’s going to be roadblocks. There’s going to be problems. That’s the only guarantee you have. 
   * You want to make over a million dollars a year - and there’s a reason that despite everyone WANTING that so few people are able to push through and actually do it. 
   * And I will tell you from experience, our best clients who ARE able to push through, they have unreasonable reason why achieving that is so important. 
   * So let me ask you… is this just a pipe dream for you? Or what are you’re reasons? What’s really at stake for you here? 
   * (you could even throw in…) it doesn’t matter to me either way, but if we’re going to take you in as a client we need to know that you have those strong reasons to push through and at the first sight of adversity you’re not going to throw in the towel and quit. 
      * Few more questions to go REALLY deep:
         * What do you want people to say at your funeral? 
         * What type of legacy do you want to leave behind? 
         * If you could have one impact on the world and be known forever for it… what would it be? 
Vision & Desire Questions: 
* When do we use? 
   * Anytime, but works best after we’ve gotten clear on pain, doubt, cost
   * Need-pay off questions create an easy transition into this part. 
* What’s the purpose? What are we looking for? 
   * Clarity on what they want (w/ data point) 
   * Reason Why (What that would do for them // would make them feel)
      * Tied to one other area of their life. 
* Key Distinctions
   *   If their goal is too low, you must stretch it (remember, the buying pocket)
      * Chunking down
      * Stories. 
   * You must get a data point. 
   * You can use “permission → reason why → question” 
* Questions To Get The Data-Point (What They Want): 
   * Need pay-off questions can all help elicit vision & desire. 
   * Ultimately, what’s the goal? 
   * What’s your target (revenue / weight / etc) 
   * What’s your ideal ____ look like (business / relationship) etc. 
   * So when you think about a business that no longer has <pain> and instead you have <what they want> - what number sticks out to you that’d you want to be pulling in NET each month consistently? 
      * So when you think about a business that instead of a trickle of lead flow has 3-5 consistent appointments every single day, week after week, once you get to that point what number would you like to see your business pulling in NET each month? 
         *    * Suppose we invite you in and show you how to fix ____ without ___. Once you’re business gets to that point, where would you like to be in terms of revenues? What’s the goal? 
   * So in order to make this happen, how do YOU need to personally show up? What type of person do you need to be able to achieve this? 
* Questions To Get Their Reason Why:
   * Can I ask you a personal question? Why is that important? 
      * ****is there any other reason getting to XYZ is important? 
   * Why not stay where you are now? 
   * Why that number? What does that change for you exactly? 
   * Getting to <data point>, ultimately, what would that do for you personally? 
   * Getting to <data point>, would that have an impact on you?
      * In what way, though? 
   * Let’s pretend you get to ___, how would that impact you? 
      * (or how would that impact the company?)
   * What would getting to ____ mean to you, personally? 
   * Would that affect any other areas of your life? 
   * You getting to ____ how do you see life being differently than it is now? 
   * How would that make you feel? 
   * What would you <spouse / family> think of you if you <insert goal>
      * What would your wife think if you starting bringing up 30k/m instead of 5k/m? 
      * I know this is a personal question… but how do you want them to think of you? 
      * What type of legacy do you want to leave behind for your family? 
      * Have you thought about the type of legacy you want to leave behind for your family? 
      * How do you want the people you’ve impacted to think about you when you’re gone? 
   * What are your non-monetary goals, your personal goals, that you want your business to allow you to achieve? 
      * And the reason I’m asking is because I don’t want to just help you build a business that’s lucrative, profitable, and builds you wealth - but also that’s not making you miserable or one that despite the money is making you question why you got into business in the first place. 
* After getting the important reasons why, if their goal is to small you may have to stretch it: 
   * First, try expanding on their vision (some people are just trying to be overly-realistic)
      * So if you got to ____, would you just stop there, or what’s next?
         * Ok then, well what’s the goal, ultimately? 
            * Then go back into probing questions… (what would that mean for you, etc) 
         * Being realistic aside, where would you really like to get this to? 
         * I think you can get there much faster than you think… remember <case study> I told you about earlier on the call? Well he came to me in a similar situation as you, but the only difference was his goal was <insert bigger goal>, and within <timeframe> he was able to get to ____. Does that make sense? 
         * So I don’t want to see you aim lower than what you’re really capable of. Are you open to setting a bigger and bit scarier goal for us to work towards? 
   * Second, chunk down to let them see that their financial goal doesn’t align with their non-financial goal
      * Gotcha so you’re goal is just 10k/m then? 
      * Ok so that’s gross… let’s account for 30% expenses which is low but we’ll play it safe. Now we’re at 7k/m. 
      * Ok so if you want to be successful in business over the long-term, then you’ll want to leave about 30% of cash in the business. That takes us down to 4.5k/m.
      * And then there’s taxes, and you’re in taxifornia so that’s around 40% again. 
      * That brings us to 2.5k a month… Now earlier on the goal you mentioned you wanted to get a mortgage, retire your wife, be able to travel, send your kids to private school… do you think 2.5k is enough to do that? 
         * Me neither let’s get you a bigger goal. What number can you shoot for is SCARY but you still believe it’s doable?  


Support Questions (Partner / Spouse)


* When do we use? 
   * For partner - during background questions (very early on)
      * As soon as we hear the words “we” that’s a red flag. 
   * For spouse - best time is when it organically comes up
      * Finances, Vision
   * Worst case, before you transition out of info-gathering. 
* What’s the purpose? What are we looking for? 
   * Do they have a partner/spouse? Are they supportive? 
   * Do they need to be on the call? 
   * Is this going to cause resistance at the end? 
* Key Distinctions
   * If you probe and there is a gray area “depends on the price” - they need to be on the call. 
   * Exceptions:
      * If the spouse who is not on the call isn’t the “alpha” of the household than a lot of times it’s not going to make sense to get them on even if the other one says they’ll have to let them know (for business ROI offers)
      * Conversely, if you don’t have the head of household on the phone OR they’re more even, you reschedule (common in weight loss offers) 
* Business Partner Questions:
   * How does the leadership structure of your company work? 
      * Are you guys 50/50? 
      * What roles do you guys have? Who is responsible for what? 
   * So earlier you said the biggest challenge is ____ who is responsible for that? 
      * ***if it’s not the person you’re speaking with, immediately reschedule. 
   * Are you guys on the same page that this is the biggest challenge in your business? 
      * What does he/she think about it? 
      * ***if their not on the same page, reschedule 
   * Does your partner know about us (the company)?
   * Does your partner know your on this call? 
      * (Optional) What would your partner think if he/she knew? 
   * Would <partner name> be working with us on this project too? Or would it just be you?
      * *** Great segway into scheduling with the partner. 
   * Do they trust you to make decisions in solving this problem? 
* Spouse Questions: 
   * What does your spouse think about this? (referencing the clients current situation) 
   * Are they supportive of you trying to fix ____? 
   * Do they also know it’s a problem? Are you guys on the same page? 
   * Are they involved in your business? What do they do? 
   * Do they know about us (the company)?
   * Do they know you’re on this call? 
      * What would they think if they knew? 
   * Let’s just pretend for a second you would move forward with something like this… would you need their permission to move forward? 
      * If you get a maybe… reschedule. 
* How I Always Reschedule:
   * Look so I get that and I agree so that’s totally fine. The biggest thing to us is ALIGNMENT. Meaning, you two are both clear and on the same page about not just the problem but the solution to it. 
   * What we want to avoid - is you being 110% certain and onboard and you’re partner feeling less-so, because it ultimately is going to lower the chance of success if you would hop in because it creates FRICTION which isn’t good for our client success rate but more important it’s going to sabotage the result that you’re after. 
      * So… I have my calendar open now, when works this week to where we can all three get on a call and get clear about the problem in your business, what your goals are, and then if it’s a fit see how you guys feel about the process? 
   * 

Trust & Transition Questions


* When do we use? 
   * We can use naturally throughout, but I like to use right before my transition/pre-pitch
* What’s the purpose? What are we looking for? 
   * Temperature Check For Last-minute timing questions… 
   * How much they know about our company and what we do
   * Helps us eliminate Uncertainty based objections like: 
      * I need to do more research on you guys
      * This sounds good but I don’t know you guys… 
      * Etc etc. 
* Key Distinctions
   * You should have a solo-page with all your case studies on it. 
   * You should have a FB group
   * This should NOT take a long time. 
   * Bonus - if you’ve seeded some case studies. 
* Questions:
   * (TEMPING TIMING)
      * Let's pretend, for a moment you were to go ahead with something that would (fix problem)... 
      * In order for most of my clients to get to ____ (result), they typically need about 10 hours a week. Is that something you’d be willing and able to commit to now? 
   * What do you know about us? 
   * How long have you been following <insert influencer>?
   * Have you checked out the Facebook group? 
      * What’d you think? Did you like anything specifically? 
   * Have you seen our success page? 
      * If not, have them pull it up. 
      * You can point out someone you mentioned earlier in the call. 
   * Now I got some feedback for you… but before we get there, anything else that we haven’t covered that you feel like I need to know?
